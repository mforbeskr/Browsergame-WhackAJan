# Browsergame-WhackAJan

**WhackAJan** is a simple browser-based game inspired by the classic *Whack-a-Mole*.

## 💡 Possible Improvements

If the game were to be improved further, the following features could be added:

### 🔥 Hard Mode Enhancements
- **Random Images:** Display different random images in hard mode to make the game more challenging and unpredictable.
- **Correct Target Scoring:** Only award points when clicking the correct image. Clicking the wrong image could give no points or deduct points.
- **Increased Gap Between Holes:** Increase the spacing between holes in hard mode so players need to move the cursor/hand/finger further, adding difficulty.
- **Countdown Before Start:** Add a short countdown (for example, 3-2-1) after pressing **Play** so the player has time to prepare before the game begins.

These improvements would make the game more engaging, challenging, and user-friendly.
